I -WILL NOT- assist with running it outside of lutris using any non-lutris installed method. There are too many requirements outside of the build itself to troubleshoot every instance that anyone has when attempting to run the game outside of lutris.\r\n\r\nAdditional note:\r\n\r\nThis build does -not- have the FSR patches. FSR sadly does not work properly withe LoL after an extended period of testing, and causes resolution issues.",

The 'old' launcher mode is what we use to login on linux,\r\n      however it uses mshtml and jscript by default, which break the 'Log In' button.\r\n      The normal way to usually get around this is to just press enter after you input your password,\r\n      but that can be annoying when you accidentally hit the button.\r\n\r\n      Here is where the workaround comes in. The ffxivboot.exe has a built-in function called IsTransgaming,\r\n      which tells the old launcher mode to use CEF instead of mshtml+jscript. When IsTransgaming is triggered,\r\n      CEF gets used and it fixes the log in button. ffxivboot64.exe does -not- have this. Additionally, a\r\n      patch was needed to trigger IsTransgaming. So, the patch to trigger IsTransgaming has been applied. \r\n      This allows the old launcher mode to be fully functional when launched via \r\n      ffxivboot.exe and using `Browser 1` in FFXIV_BOOT.cfg\r\n\r\n- Re-added missing mfplat stub that was accidentally removed from staging's mfplat patches. This re-fixes some unity games that had broken mfplat in 6.14 (Notably Oddworld: Soulstorm)\r\n- Added pending upstream wine patches for Riftbreaker\r\n- Added pending upstream winelib patch (fixes https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51596)\r\n- Wine + Wine-staging updated to 6.15\r\n",

Can be enabled with VKD3D_CONFIG=upload_hvv\r\n-AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) has been patched in as the fullscreen hack's upscaling backend. Works on most games (not all, there are some caveats). For basic usage in most case only WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 is needed. The default sharpening of 5 is enough without needing modification, but can be changed with WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=# (0-5) if wanted.\r\n\r\nDetails from pull request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/116\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of AMD's FSR https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/ in fshack, which allows users to chose it instead of linear/nearest filtering for upscaling. It can be enabled using WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 and a lower in game resolution than the display's native one. WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH controls the amount of sharpening (not to be confused with AMD's quality presets, those are about the input resolution), 0 is the maximum sharpness, higher values mean less sharpening. The default is 5.\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n\r\n    Only works in vulkan games (dxvk and vkd3d-proton included).\r\n    Some games upscale on their own, without using fshack, when you select a lower resolution in game. FSR won't work in those.\r\n    Obviously applying FSR to the final image is not ideal, it should be applied before the UI is drawn and before some post processing effects like film grain.\r\n    AMD also recommends a negative LOD bias, which is not possible in a generic way without problems.\r\n    This is only the slow fp32 version, if accepted I might follow up with the fp16 version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n-1080p, 4k, and ultrawide input quality resolutions have been added to the FSR patch. See:\r\n```\r\n    https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/#quality\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: if you want to compile this yourself for a native build, you can compile the ge-6.14 branch from http://github.com/gloriouseggroll/wine. It is already patched and ready to go.",

This is the first test build result from that.\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt to provide lutris-compatible wine builds with most of the same patches/fixes in my proton builds. Not all, but most.\r\n\r\nThis is an early test release -- mainly I'm putting this out for so many who have been trying to use proton in lutris (Don't do this please.), tested and working with GTA V online mode. You may need to adjust gamemode resolution or disable it, as lutris enables it by default and it messes with the fullscreen hack.\r\n\r\n1. Extract the tarball to ~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/. You should see other lutris wine runners in there.\r\n2. Restart lutris\r\n3. Configure the game's runner in lutris to use this build from the dropdown.",
