### CONTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENT

Thank you for your interest in HyperPlay. In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions (as defined below) from any person or entity, HyperPlay must have a Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”) on file that has been signed by each contributor indicating agreement to the HyperPlay license terms below.

This CLA is entered into as of the last date of execution below (the “Effective Date”) by and between the individual set forth in the signature block (“You” or “Your”), and HyperPlay Labs Inc. (“HyperPlay”) (each referred to as a “Party”, or collectively as the “Parties”). As used in this CLA, “You” also includes Your owners, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, members, directors, agents, attorneys and counsel, employees, successors, assigns, and any person or legal entity under common control of or with You. For legal entities, the entity making Contributions (as defined below) and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity, are considered to be a single contributor.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present and future Contributions (as defined below) submitted to HyperPlay for inclusion in any of the products owned or managed by HyperPlay (collectively, the “Platform”). In return for Your acceptance and agreement to the following terms and conditions, HyperPlay will not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to this CLA or HyperPlay’s business objectives. The terms and conditions of this CLA constitute a binding legal agreement between You and HyperPlay.

   (b)  “Submit” or “Submitted” shall mean any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to HyperPlay or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, HyperPlay for the purpose of discussing and improving the Platform, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”<br>
